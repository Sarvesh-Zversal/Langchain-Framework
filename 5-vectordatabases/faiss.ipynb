    "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library from Meta for fast similarity search and clustering of high-dimensional vectors, essential for large-scale AI applications like image/video retrieval, recommendation systems, and NLP, handling billions of vectors efficiently by creating specialized indexes for quick nearest-neighbor searches. It offers speed and memory optimization through techniques like quantization and GPU acceleration, finding items similar to a query vector even in massive datasets where traditional databases fail. "
